## GAME RULES:



If your result is exactly or higher than the percentage/time period you bet for, you win!
If you switch tabs to cheat? Ya lose!
The win depends on the result you bet for, if you bet that you'll get 70% or higher, your bet will return multiplied by 1.7x times!
If your performance is below the target, you lose entire bet, that's what risks are for!


Isn't it fun?
